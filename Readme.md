# Car Price Prediction Application
The data science project is aimed at building a machine learning model that can predict the price of cars based on various attributes such as make, model, year, and mileage. The model was trained on a large dataset obtained from various sources, after performing data analysis, data cleaning, and preprocessing. The data was then processed using various techniques such as feature engineering to improve the accuracy of the model. After experimenting with multiple models, the most accurate model was chosen as the final model.

The frontend for the project was designed using Streamlit, which allows users to input various parameters and receive the predicted price on the same page. The model was trained and tested on a large dataset, and the final model achieved a high level of accuracy. The project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting car prices and can be used by individuals or car dealerships for pricing their cars.
